# drone

  This project is aimed for people who try to create a drone by themselves!!

  In our project, we used raspberry pi zero series as control processing unit and MPU3060 module as a gyro and acceleration sensor.
  
  Moreover, we are trying to mount ImageRecognition AI to the raspberry pi. ImageGenerator.cs is for generating a vast amount of training dataset for the AI using Unity.

  We hope this project will help some enthusiastic engineers!!
