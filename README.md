![DALLÂ·E 2024-01-08 01 22 47 - An image featuring a scene where a drone is floating stably in the air  Around it, a group of enthusiastic engineers are expressing excitement and joy](https://github.com/glchisato/drone/assets/155902021/3c257e68-d741-4fcf-a3f5-8e244dff77a4)

  This project is aimed for people who try to create a drone by themselves!!

  In our project, we used raspberry pi zero series as control processing unit and MPU3060 module as a gyro and acceleration sensor.
  
  Moreover, we are trying to mount ImageRecognition AI to the raspberry pi. ImageGenerator.cs is for generating a vast amount of training dataset for the AI using Unity.

  We hope this project will help some enthusiastic engineers!!
